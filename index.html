<p>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly abbreviated to BMW (German pronunciation: [ˌbeːʔɛmˈveː] ), is a German multinational manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 to 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945 creating engines for aircraft that were used in the Second World War.

    BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built the Austin 7 under licence from Dixi. The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged BMW Dixi called the BMW 3/15, following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach.

<p>what does m power meaning ?</p>

<p>m-Power’s predecessors date back to 1983, when mrc developed the mrc-Query Series. The mrc-Query Series was originally built to enable business people at all levels to become independent of programmers. However, it developed a following with programmers and developers because it automated much of the tedious syntax work they faced on a daily basis.

  In 1987, mrc developed the mrc-Productivity Series. The mrc-Productivity Series provided web development, rapid application development, and real-time reporting capabilities in one package.[2] Additionally, it was a “trainable” code generator, meaning users could teach the mrc-Productivity Series which language to develop applications in, as well as their own coding standards and syntax.
  
  The mrc-Productivity Series, however, was limited to the DB2/400 database. In an effort to branch out beyond the AS/400 market, mrc trained the mrc-Productivity Series how to generate Java code.[3] Using the newly trained mrc-Productivity Series, mrc developed m-Power in 2004.[4]  </p>
