</head>  <h1>mpower </h1><p>m-Power’s predecessors date back to 1983, when mrc developed the mrc-Query Series. The mrc-Query Series was originally built to enable business people at all levels to become independent of programmers. However, it developed a following with programmers and developers because it automated much of the tedious syntax work they faced on a daily basis.

    In 1987, mrc developed the mrc-Productivity Series. The mrc-Productivity Series provided web development, rapid application development, and real-time reporting capabilities in one package.[2] Additionally, it was a “trainable” code generator, meaning users could teach the mrc-Productivity Series which language to develop applications in, as well as their own coding standards and syntax.
    
    The mrc-Productivity Series, however, was limited to the DB2/400 database. In an effort to branch out beyond the AS/400 market, mrc trained the mrc-Productivity Series how to generate Java code.[3] Using the newly trained mrc-Productivity Series, mrc developed m-Power in 2004.[4]  </p>
